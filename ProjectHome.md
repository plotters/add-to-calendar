# Version 0.98 #

Southwest airlines now supported.

Many european countries had ics files which couldn't be loaded.  Now they can be.

Many people were having files w/o events.  This isn't an error with my app, but somehow the application you've exported it has produced an empty file.

## Version 0.97 ##

Only a few date parsing fixes.

## Version 0.96 ##

Some people have been saying they can't open the app.  No one has logged an issue so I haven't been able to reproduce it.  But hopefully this update will fix it.  Please someone come forward and contact me about it!

Ratings are important to the development of this app.
